*adding S3*

I tried the extra credit assignment to add S3 to my blog-posting app from prior assignments.

## What Worked Well

I enjoyed creating the AWS database and connecting it to heroku. Will definitely apply to my final project.

## What Didn't

This did not really work as I imagined. I have cors errors when I try to upload a file, which suggests I have an issue with the AWS database part. Prof. Tregubov and a TA told me to submit this anyway as it demonstrated I tried to add in the S3 and wrote the necessary code for the assignment.
